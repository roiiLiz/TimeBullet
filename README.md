## Project Goals

The main goal of this project is to take a deeper dive into several mechanics and programming paradigms that I haven't worked with before. For example, the time dialation mechanic, which leverages the event system, gave me a deeper understanding of both how events work as well as how I should adjust my code to fit such architecture.
